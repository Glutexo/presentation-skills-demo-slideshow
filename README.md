# Presentation skills demo slideshow #

## Summary ##

This is a short slideshow for Presentation skills workshop. The topic of the talk is warning about file encodings.

Every plain text is a text only if we know its encoding, otherwise it is just a binary blob. Source code is plain text and the interpreter must know the encoding. UTF-8 is now default, at least for Ruby and Python, but it has not been always like this.

There are some means how to specify the encoding of a source file. They have some caveats though. When weâ€™re dealing with shebangs, there might even not be a solution.
